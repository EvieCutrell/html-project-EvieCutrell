            Hello! My name is Evelynn Cutrell, but I typically go by Evie. I live with my amazing spouse, our dog Thor, and our 'cat' (prounounced as gremlin) Preston,
            in the greater Seattle area. I am a problem-solver and technical thinker who likes knowing the how and why. <br><br>
            Some of my favorite hobbies include miniature building and painting, video games, reading, and recently I've gotten into botany and hiking.<br><br>
            One of my favorite book series is 
            called "Stormlight Archives" by Brandson Sanderson: it's a fantasy series that currently sits at five books (with a total of ten planned) and each book is over 1,200 pages.
            For board games I enjoy all kinds, but more-often-than-not play a strategy, resource-management, or deckbuilding game. As for video games I typically enjoy narrative-driven 
            games or crafting sims. I am hoping to eventually get my botany skills to the point of identifying edible plants and being able to safely make at-home remedies.
